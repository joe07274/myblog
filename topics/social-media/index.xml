My boss is on twitter“. Allow me to share a secret with you, if you current boss isn’t on twitter yet, I can guarantee that your next one will be. Social media has caught on like wildfire. In all the excitement too often people forget that everything that you say on twitter / facebook and others is being published and recorded.</description>

      <title>A Better Follow Friday</title>

      <description>&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/media/twitter-following.jpg&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  Follow Friday is a common practice on Twitter where many people spend friday posting things like #FF @aplusk @guykawasaki … This practice is distracting at best and fails to accomplish the single purpose it intends. Follow friday began as way to share lesser known twitter users with your community. A great idea that quickly grew out of control. I propose a better implementation that will not only accomplish the original intent but will do so in a non-distrcting manner by leveraging twitter lists.</description>

      <description>Earlier this week Seth Godin announced his first presence on twitter with the post Delivering blogs via Twitter..
 You can receive instant daily updates of this blog by following @thisissethsblog. I create the tweets automatically using a service called twitterfeed. It’s free and it works really well. (PS this is my only presence on Twitter… I’m focused on the blog and my books, and alas can’t tweet and do that at the same time).</description>

      <title>54% US Companies Ban Social Media... and That&#39;s Fine</title>

      <description>&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/media/twitter-logo.png&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  According to a study commissioned by Robert Half Technology, an IT staffing company, 54 percent of U.S. companies say they’ve banned workers from using social networking sites like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and MySpace while at work. Source: 54% of Companies ban Facebook, Twitter…
We should be shocked that this number isn’t higher. Let’s look at this realistically. For many professions, networking is crucial to success, but in most professions, it is personal networking, not online that is beneficial.</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/media/pingfm.png&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  As social media continues to emerge, many professionals are curious on what is the best way to manage these various networks. For posting updates I have found ping.fm an invaluable resource. I use it to manage updates across all my networks including Twitter, Facebook,LinkedIn, Flicker, FriendFeed and more. Here’s the skinny on how I utilize this resource.
If you’re not familar with ping.fm it enables one to post updates to one or many different websites though email, web, IM, SMS and widgets.</description>

      <title>The Death of Search</title>
      <link>https://spf13.com/post/the-death-of-search/</link>

      <description>Social media will be the next innovation in the most unlikely of places, search ( leveraging the community to scale infinitely ). It’s not that people will all together stop searching, but the approach that they take to finding information will become increasingly social (rather than algorithmic) in nature.
For the last decade, search always seems on the cusp of “intelligent” results. Each new engine promises to be able to overcome “search overload” as Microsoft puts is.</description>

      <title>Ranking Social Media</title>

      <description>&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/media/twitter-following.jpg&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  In business it’s common to use sales as a metric to determine success. Songs, albums, books and movies are all ranked on “best seller” charts. While this isn’t a perfect metric, it is largely useful due to the innate control built within. There is friction to a sale in that buying something costs money of which people have a limited supply. This makes it so that someone couldn’t just repeatedly buy their own song, album, book or movie and have a best seller (not to mention they would be losing a ton of money to the distribution and retail channels).</description>

The http://www.new.facebook.com website is a preview of the next design of Facebook. The new design places more emphasis on friends and actions and downplays the applications. There is a lot more than just design going on. They also reveal some new functionality. I will present an in-depth review of what to expect from Facebook complete with screenshots.</description>

It has since become popular, and like the kids trying to be popular in high school, has become a whore. Not that it was ever exclusive by restrictions, but rather by obscurity.</description>

It’s easy to see why. Twitter is addicitve. Many twitter users are constantly on twitter. Whenever you goto twitter there is always something new happening. Facebook obviously wants this experience on facebook. Why not copy twitter. I think Facebook could do it and do it better.</description>

      <title>Hire Your Next Consultant Using Twitter</title>

      <description>At Portero we had an issue with our network.
I know enough about networking to understand the basics. I actually used to work on the IOS back during the dawn of the internet. Though things have changed since then, the biggest issue is I don’t remember enough to fix network configuration issues on the router level.
Before I took the post at Portero, we had a company we contracted to configure all of our Cisco equipment.</description>

When I first heard about microblogging—or Twitter, the primary service that started the microblogging movement—over a year ago I thought it was a stupid fad and wouldn’t last. I mean what value can possibly be passed along in 140 characters or less.</description>
